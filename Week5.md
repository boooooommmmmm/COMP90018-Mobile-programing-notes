## Context awareness

**The definition of context:**
Who What When Why.
Relevant of interaction between user and application.

**Context**

* Context display ->GPS can show the location to user directly.
* Context augmentation -> Google album create the album based on where you take the picture.
* Context-aware configuration
* Context-triggered action -> change
* Contextual adoption of the environment
* Contextual mediation
* Context-aware presentation

What the activity the user behaving

### Execution

Online -> give feedback at real time
Offline -> Analisis data latter

### Generalisation

User independent -> training on huge user data and build model

User specific -> single user

Temporal -> combine


### Recognition

Continuous

Segmented 分段的


### Activities

Periodic 周期的

Sporadic 不定期的

Static


### System model

stateless

stateful





### Choosing Sensors

* what is it measuring
* Accuracy and precision -> Accuracy ->The distance of the main value to true value. ->Precision-> How spitting your value distribution.
* range of the sensor
* resolution or sensitivity of the sensor
* sampling rate or frame rate
* cost

Preprocessing

### Segmentation

* sliding window ->Non-overlapping sliding window -> overlapping sliding window
* energy based ->threshhold
* additional context sources


### Feature Extraction


### Classification
