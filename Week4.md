# Challenges in Sensor Data
Most like data will be like time serious
1. The value of sensor data in t will strongly influence sensor at **time** t+1. => GPS
2. Every sensor has **sampling rate** -> the data is disparate -> no idea of what happens between sampling rate.
3. Don't have **enough data point**.
4. Remove **noise** -> may lose some information of data.


### Mean Filter

Create the window of a given size, wait till window full, each value will be replaced by the mean value in the given window.


Two problems: 

1. wait till window full -> delay of the computation. 
2. No sharp edges. -> Highly outliers data will effect the accuracy?


### Weighted Mean Filter

The old measurement still has effect, the newer, the larger effect.

### Median Filter

Less susceptible to outliers. 

Does not make up data.

computing/pick the median.

Always use the value exist on the window -> doesn't create the data.    

good for have the sharp corners.

---

trajectory smooth, minimize the difference.

Rare using mean filter for sensor data, median filter always performance better.

### Kalman Filter

underlying velocity

1. Make prediction most like value based on dynamic model.
2. measure, use sensor data to correct the prediction.

Storing the velocities

Dynamic model of the system
No lag
Tunable trade-off between model and measurement.
Uncertainty estimate

DIA:

parameters are not intuitive
Overshooting

Bayesian: use Bayesian rule to estimate the possibility. 
**Gaussian**: noisy distribute is Gaussian
**Linear**
Online: no lag



### Particle Filter

Bayesian

Gaussian or not, do not have to be

Linear or not

Online



General

Continuous or discrete vars

Great results

Memory usage

Slow, expensive, higher memory
