## Waves of Mobile Computing
<br />
Seven waves of mobile computing.
<br />

### Portability: 

Making computers small enough to move easily.

### Miniaturisation: 

Making computers can be carried wherever we go.  The devices each had their own operating systems, optimized for their particular screen sizes and input capabilities, and a suite of standard applications for calendars, 

### Connectivity: 

Allow users to be online and communicate via wireless data networks. Mobile phones become the main stream. Multiply type and T9 keyboard. The appearance of WAP (Wireless Application Protocol). In 1991, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) included the Short Message Service (SMS). 

### Convergence: 

Bringing device types together. One device can provide multiple functionalities (PDA and phone together). Smartphones.
The second phase of convergence combined mobile phones with various rich media capabilities.

### Divergence: 

Focused on specialized functionality. PSP/iPod
Having a wide range of good specialised tools is better than a general one that does not perform any task particularly well

### Apps: 

Making mobile phones into general purpose mobile computers.

### Digital Ecosystems: 

Pervasive and interrelated technologies working together.


### 4C Framework

A way to analyze and understand existing digital ecosystems and design new ones.


[Communality, Collaboration, Continuity, Complementarity]

**Communality**: (集体性) Sequential interaction involving several users.

**Collaboration**: (合作) Simultaneous interaction by many users.

**Continuity**: (连续) Sequential interaction involving several artifacts.

**Complementarity**: (补充) Simultaneous interaction with multiple artifacts.

Each of them has 2 principles.


|              | Many Users                               | Many artifacts                           |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| sequential   | **Communality**  <br/>  1. **Personalization** <br/>  the artifact is personalized to each user <br/>  2. **Generalization** <br/>  the artifact allows different users to immediately interact without any knowledge of their identity | **Continuity** <br/>   1. **synchronization** <br/>  a user’s data is synchronized across artifacts <br/>  2. **migration** <br/>  the state of a user’s activity is migrated from one artifact to another |
| simultaneous | **Collaboration** <br/> 1. **division** <br/>  the artifact is divided into independent sections and each user can interact with it simultaneously <br/>  2. **merging** <br/>  the artifact merges all users’ interaction | **Complementarity**  <br/> 1. **extension**  <br/>  interaction with an artifact is extended to  another  <br/> 2. **remote control** <br/>  one artifact is used to control another |
