### UX
Responses
* Visceral: The subconscious reaction based on appearance. {Look, Feel, Sound} (What you think when you first time see/hear/sound about it)
* Behavioural: The reaction that stems from the ease of difficulty of use. {Function, Understandability, Usability, Physical feel}(You need to use it for a while)
* Reflective: The reaction that derives from self-image, experience and memories.(脑补出来的)
  <br>

<br>

### HCD-Human Centered Design
Shared value
* Desirability: Wishes of stakeholders                          //Do they want this?
* Feasibility: Your ability to deliver                               //Can we do this?
* Viability: Whether you should even start the project  //Should we do this?
  <br>

**Double Diamond**
[Discovery, Definition, How might we so that, Development, Delivery,** Convergent x Divergent Thinking**]
<br>
**Spiral**

<br>
<br>

**Problem to solution**
* Discover - Insight into the problem
* Define - Define what problem is, what actually trying to solve.
* Develop - prototype/ potential solutions
* Deliver - solutions that work
  <br>
  <br>

### Research methods
* Looking - context is important / Ethnography - image you are users themselves / Shadowing - data management, closely following a person over a period of time / Video diary - camera may affect the behavior, have to let others know about it.
    Learning
* Asking - Questionnaires, interviews, contextual inquiry, guessability, experience sampling
* Prototyping - Sketching, task flows, paper prototypes, carousel, wireframes, high fidelity prototypes
* Testing - Common myths about reasons for not doing it, large x multiple studies,  discount usability, eye tracking
* Putting all together - mobile HCI research, behavioral x attitudinal methods, quantitative x qualitative methods, lab x in-the-wild

  Cultural probes (or design probes) is a technique used to inspire ideas in a design process. The aim is to elicit inspirational responses from people, in order to understand their culture, thoughts and values better, and thus stimulate designer's imaginations.

Quizzes: Angry bird
	Visceral:
	         What the user think this gaming looks like at the first time. Like:
	              "Oh, the birds are cute, their colour and modellings are impressive."
	              "Oh, the pigs are ugly and evil, let's defeat them."
	         Well, generally speaking, the visceral response is good for this game and it is impressive when the user first time sees this game.
Behavioural:
We can control which angle and how hard strength we throw the birds away. If we can successfully defeat the pigs in require time, the users will feel good - they made it. 
The animation of control birds flying angle and speed and the knock against with target is good, users may enjoy it will playing games. 
Reflective
Believe it or not, this game is trying to stop but cannot.

All in all, I think this game is well-designed and under good user experience and fits these three kinds of response well.

Quizzes: Imagine you were hired by a cinema chain to build a Hololens application to help customers find their cinemas as they walk around Melbourne. Assess whether this project creates shared value under the desirability, feasibility, and viability lenses.

Desirability: Yes, clients need this function to find a nearby cinema or high rank or any cinemas they want. This application can fit users' desire.

Feasibility: Personally thinking, the technical is not difficult, google maps and hololens can provide APIs and platform. It will not take too long with a low fail rate.

Viability: I think this application fits business goals and budget.
---------
<br>

What were the goals of this project?
To understand how technologies are used and negotiated among family members and the influence of technology on commensality.
Summarise the method that the authors used to collect and analyse the data:
Ethnography
Shadowing 
Video diary
What conclusion did they get to based on this research?
Theu had explored current practices around the personal and shared devices and analyzed how they support familial conversation, provide relaxation, achieve satiety, and enable celebration, albeit not without occasional tension.

# How to make an interview
***
This is a guest speech.
***
Why interview is important: it can find out human needs, context, and function requirement.

### How to start an interview: 
* Introduce yourself, the topic and the aim of the interview. How long will it take?
* Ask participant tell them a little bit, like where they from, do they have families? -> get the context of the participants.
  <br />

### Things need to pay attention while asking questions：
* Open - ended questions
* Always ask why
* Be natural -> don't read your questions one by another.
  <br />
* Framing: what this is about
* No bias, no judgment
* Body language
* Tone of voice and vocabulary
* Avoiding questions? Being nice? -> Let participant be honest, no judgment.

### Roles
* Researcher
* Note taker -> try to not ask questions, unless researcher asks you to ask.
* Participant
  <br />

### How to get your topic back?
"Your idea is interesting, I don't want to waste your time/I don't want to take you half of the day, let's go back to our topic."
<br />
### One-word answer and shy participant
* Make them feel comfortable -> warm up
  <br />

### How to let information make sense.
Organize<br />
Classify<br />
converge questions<br />
start prototyping<br />
